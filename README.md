# Real-Time Emotion Detection

## Overview

The Real-Time Emotion Detection project utilizes computer vision and deep learning techniques to enable the real-time recognition and classification of facial expressions. The system processes live video feeds or images, employing pre-trained deep learning models to recognize and classify facial expressions. This application finds applications in human-computer interaction, user experience analysis, and emotional well-being monitoring.


## Features

- **Real-Time Processing**: The system can process live video feeds in real-time, providing instantaneous results.
- **Multiple Emotion Classes**: The deep learning model classifies facial expressions into multiple emotion classes, providing a nuanced understanding of the user's emotional state.
- **Customization**: The codebase is modular and can be easily customized to accommodate different use cases, datasets, or deep learning architectures.

## Dependencies
- **Python 3.9**
- **NumPy**
- **OpenCV**
- **TensorFlow**
